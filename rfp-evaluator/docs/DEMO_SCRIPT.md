# Demonstration script (about 4 minutes)

Record the screen with the deployed Streamlit Cloud URL open. If you have an API key, use it; otherwise use
Offline demo and say so.

## 1. Criteria from SQLite (30 s)
* Open **1 · Criteria**. Point out: 5 active criteria, weights total 100%, max score 10.
* Change *Technical Capability* weight to 40 and show the red error ("weights must total 100%") and the
  disabled Save button. Change it back to 30.

## 2. Input and input validation (45 s) - error case #1
* Open **2 · Suppliers & Evaluate** and turn on **Use the 5 bundled synthetic RFP PDFs**
  (or upload the PDFs from `sample_rfps/`).
* Rename *BrightPath Tech* to *Apex Systems*. Show the "Duplicate supplier name" error and the disabled
  Evaluate button. Change a submission date to a future date to show the date error. Undo both.
* Optional: upload a non-PDF renamed to `.pdf` to show "not a valid PDF file".

## 3. Successful run (60 s)
* Click **Evaluate suppliers**. Show the progress and status messages (one evaluation per supplier, then
  scoring and ranking).
* **3 · Leaderboard:** rank, absolute score, PPI, date, experience, and the "Why this position" column.
  Show the peer-comparison matrix.
* **4 · Scorecards:** pick NexaWorks. Show score, benchmark, gap, relative %, weight, then open an evidence
  expander to show the quote and justification.
* **5 · Run details:** RFP_RUN_ID, tie-break rules and explanations, benchmarks, agent trace. Click
  **Download complete result (JSON)**.

## 4. Validation case (45 s) - error case #2
* Back on tab 2, open **Validation demo**, choose *NexaWorks*, and evaluate again.
* On **5 · Run details**, show the warnings: score 15 clipped to 10, "eight" set to 0, unknown criterion 999
  ignored, missing criterion imputed 0, missing evidence, supplier-name mismatch corrected.
* Note that the run still completed, and that NexaWorks now ranks lower because of the imputed zeros.
  Every change is traceable.

## 5. Persistence (20 s)
* Open **History**. Both runs are stored in SQLite, each with its own run id. Load the first run again.

Close with: "The LLM only produced the scorecards. Every number on the leaderboard comes from the
formulas and tie-break rules shown in Run details."
